Now introducing... our first online event of the year!
A while ago we recommended everyone to have a go at ångstromCTF and apply all the skills you have gathered in our workshops. This week we will hear how different teams solved challenges in a few lightning-talk-style presentations. Join us to learn some practical approaches to solving CTF challenges!

This workshop will be held online on Discord (join here https://discord.gg/JmXrDF7) so you can join in and watch from the comfort and safety of your home! It will be on Thursday between 6:30pm and 8:30pm.
