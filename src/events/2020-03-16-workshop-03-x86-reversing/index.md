Often times the key to finding vulnerabilities in applications is first figuring out how they work. This can be rather difficult when the application is given is the form of a compiled binary!

This week we'll be having a look at the basics of reverse engineering. We'll be introducing you to the fundamentals of the x86 instruction set and teaching you how to read assembly language, starting all the way from just an empty program. There will be plenty of CTF challenges to practice on, plus free pizza as always!

Hope to see you there!
