To rekindle our cybersecurity journey, this workshop will feature a refresher on where we ended last semester, updates on what happened over the break and for our new members, a little into to what we do. 

So come along to catch up with old friends or make new ones as we progress to become the ultimate hackers.
Or come along just for the FREE™ pizza- we don’t mind!

FREE™ memberships will also be up for grabs - just ask for the special challenge.
