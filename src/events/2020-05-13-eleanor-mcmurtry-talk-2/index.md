Ever wondered why we can put so much trust in encryption on the internet? In this workshop, Eleanor will explain how cryptographers think about security, introducing some mathematical models and demonstrating how we can prove our cryptographic schemes meet the mark. They will give a specific example of security for the ElGamal cryptosystem they introduced last time, but prior knowledge is not strictly required. You will come out of this workshop with a new understanding of what cryptography promises us, and what details are left to implementations.

The lecture will be livestreamed from Eleanor's Twitch.tv (https://www.twitch.tv/ellierigby)
