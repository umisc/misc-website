Webster's dictionary defines steganography as the art or practice of concealing a message, image, or file within another message, image, or file.
We define it as an excuse to look at cat pictures all day.
This week we take a look at various ways to hide messages and secrets in other files and answer the question does baby shark contain hidden secrets from Russian spies?

Pizza ( free of hidden messages) will be provided along with cat pictures.
