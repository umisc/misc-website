Hi all, hope you enjoyed our guest speaker last week! 

This week we'll be continuing on with our workshops, this time learning about Injection vulnerabilities! Injection vulnerabilities are a critical way that web applications can be exposed to a malicious attack and will serve fundamental to your penetration testing skills, so make sure you come along and feel free to bring your friends!

As usual, there will be **pizza** so get around it.
