One of the most popular public key cryptosystems in research, ElGamal is actually quite easy to understand even without much maths background. Eleanor, a Master of Computer Science student researching applied cryptography, will take you on a tour through how the cryptosystem works, a basic approach to implementation, and some of the neat things you can do with it (that aren't so easy to do with other systems). This will touch on issues such as chosen-plaintext attacks, indistinguishability for eavesdroppers, and how to construct some basic cryptographic proofs. The only pre-requisite is very basic familiarity with the idea of asymmetric (public-private) cryptography.

The talk will be streamed on Discord, so make sure to join if you haven't already! https://discord.gg/JmXrDF7
