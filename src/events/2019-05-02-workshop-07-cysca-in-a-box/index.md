Are you ready to put your knowledge into practice?

John and Kaif will be helping us walk through some Capture The Flag challenges which have featured in Australia's premier CTF, CySCA.

This week we will be focusing on problems from CySCA 2017. 
Be sure to download the CySCA in a box file beforehand:

We will go through the setup process as well so don't sweat if you cant get it working before hand.

As usual, we will be providing semi-nutritional lunchtime nourishment for all members, so bring your laptops and your hunger for hacking (and for pizza).
