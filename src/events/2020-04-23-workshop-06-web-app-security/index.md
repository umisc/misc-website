We hope you all had a nice mid semester break! We'll be continuing with workshops this week online on Discord. We will take a look at some common and interesting vulnerabilities that have been breaking websites since it was a thing. We'll also see some ways you can protect yourself against these attacks as a developer. Come participate in this workshop by joining the Discord (if you haven't already): https://discord.gg/JmXrDF7 this Thursday 6:30PM!
