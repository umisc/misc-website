Same old Same old. This week we continue with CySCA 2017 in a box and continue to work on more challenges. If you were not able to set it up last workshop, we will be going around helping people with that as well. 
Our Education officers will be giving an Intro on OWASP and how it relates to your career in cybersecurity. 
As usual Pizza will be served.
