This week we will be exploring the world of binary exploitation. We will be examining programs in detail, and learning how to identify and exploit common unsafe practices. Exploits will be introduced from first principles, followed by a brief discussion on useful tools to automate and work with these techniques more efficiently.

As usual, the event will be held on [Discord](https://discord.gg/JmXrDF7).

See you all there!
